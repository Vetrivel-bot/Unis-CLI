<h1 align="center">UniS — Secure Communication Ecosystem</h1>

Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2025 Project — ID: SIH25184
UniS (Unified Secure Communication System) is a defense-grade, end-to-end encrypted communication ecosystem built for the Smart India Hackathon 2025.
It provides secure text, voice, and video communication, encrypted file sharing, and multi-level access control — purpose-built for defense, government, and institutional networks.

Beyond standard encryption, UniS employs a hybrid network security layer integrating VPN-based tunneling, network isolation, and traffic obfuscation to ensure that communication remains protected even across public or compromised networks.
All data is routed through secure cloud tunnels or private mesh nodes, forming a virtual intranet accessible only by authorized users.
The system supports dynamic VPN provisioning, enabling defense departments or government agencies to spin up secure, temporary communication networks on demand.

UniS aims to be a sovereign Indian communication platform, blending advanced encryption, secure VPN infrastructure, and policy-driven access control — making it a future-ready solution for national-grade confidential communication.

⚙️ Installation & Setup
📱 Frontend (React Native)

git clone [https://github.com/V/Unis-CLI.git](https://github.com/Vetrivel-bot/Unis-CLI)

npm install

npx react-native run-android

🔄 System Architecture

Client (UniS App) encrypts all messages before sending.

Server acts as a secure relay using Socket.IO (no message access).

Receiver App decrypts the message locally.

Files stored temporarily using encrypted file storage.

💡 This ensures true end-to-end encryption — even the server can’t read user data.

🧪 Future Roadmap
